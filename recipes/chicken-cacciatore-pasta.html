        <ul>
            <li>4 (11 ounce) chicken leg quarters</li>
            <li>1 3/4 teaspoons salt, or more to taste, divided</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, cut into strips</li>
            <li>1 cup sliced onion</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried thyme</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) can tomato puree</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>1 (15.5 ounce) can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
            <li>8 ounces dried fusilli or penne pasta</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Sprinkle chicken with 1 teaspoon salt. Heat oil in a wide, heavy, oven-safe pot over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking, about 1 minute. Add chicken, skin sides down, and cook, turning once, until browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a plate.</li>
            <li>Pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat. Reduce heat to medium and cook pepper, onion, and garlic, stirring, until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in oregano, thyme, tomato puree, water, and remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt; bring to a simmer. Return chicken to pot, return to a simmer, cover, and transfer to oven. Bake until chicken is tender, 45 to 50 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer chicken to a bowl and chill, uncovered, until cool enough to handle (20 minutes). Discard skin and bones. Pull meat into coarse shreds.</li>
            <li>Add chicken, beans, and vinegar to tomato mixture in pot and simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, cook pasta in salted water according to package directions. Drain, reserving 1 cup pasta water. Stir pasta into chicken mixture, thinning with pasta water as needed. Season with additional salt, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
